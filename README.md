# 🌍 LULC Change Detection and Prediction

This project focuses on **Land Use and Land Cover (LULC)** change detection and future prediction using satellite imagery and machine learning. By analyzing spatial patterns over time, it aims to provide insights into urban expansion, deforestation, agricultural shifts, and other major land transformations.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Detect LULC changes from multi-temporal satellite imagery
- Visualize historical land cover changes using remote sensing data
- Predict future LULC scenarios using machine learning models

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 **Change Detection** using NDVI and classification techniques
- 🛰️ **Satellite Imagery Analysis** (Sentinel, Landsat)
- 🧾 **Data Preprocessing**: Noise reduction, band selection, cloud masking
- 🧮 **ML-Based Prediction**: Random Forest / XGBoost for land cover forecasting
- 🌐 **Visualization**: Heatmaps and color-coded LULC maps using Matplotlib / Folium / QGIS
